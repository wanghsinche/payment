# SEMIPAY - An Open Source Wechat Payment Solution

Welcome to SEMIPAY, a semi-automatic WeChat payment solution that can be easily deployed privately with a single click on Vercel.

It helps create a personal semi-automatic payment collection system and eliminates the need for record filing and transaction fees associated with online payments

You can also use the popular `wechaty` [https://wechaty.js.org/](https://wechaty.js.org/) to monitor WeChat payment messages and achieve fully automatic collection. A fully automatic collection system is very complicated and there is a risk of being blocked by WeChat, so I won't demonstrate it.

## Main Features
- âš¡ One-click free deployment through Vercel. Add the required configuration and you can immediately have your own WeChat payment system.
- ðŸ’¬ Supports multiple notification methods such as Telegram bot (recommended), Email (you need to replace it with your own SMTP email in the code), webhook, etc.
- ðŸŽ¨ Easy to operate, update the configuration in Vercel edge config to take effect immediately.
- ðŸŒˆ Safe and open source, no need to worry about funding issues.
## Demo

Get the test checkout link: [https://payment-mauve.vercel.app](https://payment-mauve.vercel.app)

## Usage

### Prepare the configuration
- Copy the `examle.edge.conf.json` configuration template and initialize your [vercel edge config](https://vercel.com/dashboard/stores/edge-config).
- Prepare multiple WeChat payment QR codes with different remarks and fixed amounts, and upload them to the network (such as GitHub or object storage servers).
- After obtaining the URL that can be accessed directly, fill in the `qrcode` field.
- Purchase a domain name that can be used in China (hostname), or you can use the domain name provided by Vercel directly.
- Set up the email or Telegram bot (recommended) link, key, and payment site hostname.
- Set the address of `confirmWebhook` for the callback after the order is confirmed. The sample request is shown below:

```bash
curl -X POST <confirmWebhook>&token=<token> \n
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \n
-d '{"price":<price>,"user":"<user>","extra":"<extra>","uid":"<uid>","remark":"<remark>","timestamp":<timestamp>}'
```

- generate token 
```js 
// info is the payload that needs to be signed
const secret = process.env.SECRET;
// Sort in alphabetical order
const text = Object.keys(info).sort().map(k=> info[k]).join(','); 
// Use sha256 to encrypt the information
const token = createHmac('sha256', secret).update(text).digest('base64');
```

- Keep the `webhook` field consistent with `confirmWebhook`.

In short, the code is all here, no need for me to explain more.


### Set up the config

use the following JSON sample to set up your vercel edge-config
https://vercel.com/dashboard/stores/edge-config

```json
{
  "qrcode": [
    {
      "url": "https://..co/storage/v1/object/public/static/five1.jpg",
      "remark": "five1",
      "price": 5
    },
    {
      "url": "https://..co/storage/v1/object/public/static/five2.jpg",
      "remark": "five2",
      "price": 5
    },
    {
      "url": "https://..co/storage/v1/object/public/static/five3.jpg",
      "remark": "five3",
      "price": 5
    }
  ],
  "webhook": "https://ok/api/wepaynotify?",
  "telegram": "https://api.telegram.org/botxxxx:xxxx/sendMessage?chat_id=xxx&",
  "email": "",
  "notifier": "",
  "hostname": "https://pay",
  "confirmWebhook": "https://ok/api/wepaynotify?",
  "secret": "123"
}
```

### To get a checkout link from your business server

```js
const hostname = 'https://your.pay.domain';
// prepare your info
const info = {
    price: 0,
    user: 'donate@user.com',
    extra: 'donate',
    timestamp: Date.now()
};

// get the secret
const secret = process.env.SECRET;
// in alphabet order
const text = Object.keys(info).sort().map(k=> info[k]).join(','); 
// use sha256 to encrypt your info
const token = createHmac('sha256', secret).update(text).digest('base64');


const checkout = await fetch(`${hostname}/api/checkout`, {
    method: 'post',
    body: JSON.stringify({...info, token})
}).then(res=>{
    if(res.status !== 200) throw new Error(res.status);
    return res;
}).then(res=>res.json());

// get the checkout url
console.log(checkout);

// After the user clicks on the checkout page, if a Telegram bot is configured, a message will be received
/**
  A checkout was placed 
    
    -user: wanghsinche@hotmail.com
    -price: 5
    -remark: five1
    -extra: manual-5
    -uid: a3f65157-b9f5-49ad-95bf-7967200a3b38

    click here to confirm the payment
 * 
 * /
// Clicking will confirm the order and call the confirmWebhook address to send a confirmation message.

```
